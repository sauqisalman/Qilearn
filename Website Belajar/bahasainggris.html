      <h2>The Importance of Education</h2>
      <p>
        The honorable, my teacher, and my beloved friends, good morning. First
        of all, thank you for having me here in this fine and joyfull morning. I
        hope we are all in the good health. Today I would convey in the
        importance of education in my short speech. On many occasions we hear
        the term education, but what is education? How importance is education
        to our country and ourselves as students?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, to answer the first question, education refers to a process by
        which a person develops their skills, attitudes and values. Many times
        we associate this term with the school, however we must also take into
        account that education is not exclusive to this institution, but also it
        is up to the family and even to the friendships with whom we live
        together day by day, that is why we can say that “men can get to improve
        each other.” There is a phrase that I like very much and I find it very
        true. If the people of a country care about the education, it shows that
        they love their nation. It is said that in order for a country to
        prosper it needs education, but why?
      </p>
      <p>
        The honorable audiences, we study not to go to the graduation ceremony
        and hang our picture on the wall of our house, much less to show off to
        our friends. we study to practice and to acquire knowledge, and those
        two then will prepare us to the real life situation. Education brings us
        too many benefits, such as confidence in ourselves, freedom to decide,
        conscience as a whole, help us to improve ourselves, to feel fulfilled,
        to feel that we are something in life and that we have an end for which
        to live. But this is not the only satisfaction that education gives us,
        but with it we achieve a better quality of life; When we want to buy a
        dress, shoes, food, or anything else, we need a work, which currently is
        not so easy to find and less if we don’t have an adequate education.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is said that the future of our country is in the hands of the
        children and as the children in this country, we must try hard to
        achieve that. That is why today I invite all the audiences here to
        reflect on the importance of education. We have to take advantage of
        this chance to be able to go to school to study. We must appreciate the
        effort that our parents make to send us to school, and think that there
        are many children who would like to study but for some reason they can
        not do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, ask ourselves: without effort and education, how do we want to
        improve ourselves? How do we want to live better? In short, how do we
        want a better country?. Therefore, education is an important part of our
        life as well as an essential part to develop a better future for the
        country. So this is the end of my speech today. I hope some of the
        points that I have conveyed today make us more appreciate of our chance
        to be able to have the education at school and make us study more
        dilligently for both our country’s and our own future. I thank you for
        the attention. Good day.
